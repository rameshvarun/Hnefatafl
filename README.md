## Overview
Hnefatafl is a family of 2-player Viking board games, where one player tries to guide a King to a refugee square, while attackers try to prevent this. Right now, we're implementing the popular 11x11 variant - Feltar Hnefatafl. To learn more about Hnefatafl + it's history, check out this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gND2P1sHM3U.

## Programming Patterns
### Retrolambda
Right now, we're using Retrolambda, which lets you use Java 8 lambda syntax. Essentially, this works in any situation in which you would create an anonymous class from an single-function interface. Careful though, as anything you capture will be kept around by the GC, since it is tied to the life of the lambda.
```java
builder.setTitle("You Have Won The Game.")
  .setPositiveButton("Return to Menu", (DialogInterface sideDialog, int which) -> {
    NavUtils.navigateUpFromSameTask(this);
  }).show();
```
### Stream API Backport
We're also using a backport of the Java 8 Stream API, which lets you do stuff like `map`, `filter`, `all`, etc. Perfect for use with Retrolambda.
```java
return Stream.of(Direction.values()).allMatch((Direction dir) -> {
  // The King is only captured when surrounded on all four sides.
  Position adjacent = defendingPos.getNeighbor(dir);
  return pieces.containsKey(adjacent) && pieces.get(adjacent).hostileTo(piece);
});
```
### Prefer Optional<T> over a Nullable Variable
If you do need to have an extra "undetermined" state for a value, it might be better to use the Optional wrapper (part of the Stream backports). Optional will force you to do an `isPresent` check, thus preventing easy mistakes where you try to operate on a `null` object.

### Other
- Generally avoid nulls
- Try to use `final` wherever it makes sense.
- Prefer creating a getter over simply making a variable public (yeah I know, it's verbose, but it communicates that outside classes shouldn't just change the value)
- Prefer composition over inheritance (Gang of Four / Effective Java advice)

## Packages
- [Simulator](./app/src/main/java/net/varunramesh/hnefatafl/simulator) - The simulator handles all of the rules of Hnefatafl, exporting the `Board`class that represents the state of a game.
- [Hnefatafl AI](./app/src/main/java/net/varunramesh/hnefatafl/ai) - This package implements various strategies for controlling the AI player in Player vs. AI games.
- [The Game](./app/src/main/java/net/varunramesh/hnefatafl/game) - This package handles all of the drawing / input, using LibGDX.
